## TODO Stories

- [x] create express server
- [x] split fetch into a utils/api and write test for it
- [x] create basic container with conditional render of pages(Form, search result & Error Page)
- [x] display all details required in search item

- [ ] sorting function
- [ ] reset form
- [ ] star ratings
- [x] proper styling

## Trade Off
- lazy loading of image
- ways to reset form without having to refresh
- responsive page
- writing test SearchContainer and the react hooks
