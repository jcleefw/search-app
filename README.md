## Trade Off

Due to time limitation time, below are a few things that have been trade off or partially implemented.

- the only accepted input for the search is `sydney`. The results is hard coded to only return results with the input.
- most cases it this app handles happy cases assuming that data has been serialized.
- Didn't have enough time to do the `Star ratings` function.
- Better handling for lazy loading of image
- Should implement a way to refresh the form without having to refresh the page.
- Writing test SearchContainer, the sorting of list by for Price sort when comes to dealing with the hooks and state change
- Setup PropTypes for the React component
- SearchItem can be refactored to smaller components.
- Proper error handling with status code if server is not connected.
